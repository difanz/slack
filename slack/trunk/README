slack is a configuration management system designed to appeal to lazy admins
(like me).  It's an evolution from the usual "put files in some central
directory" that is faily common practice.

Setting up slack for rsyncd over ssh

1) Generate a public/private keypair for SSH
2) Put the private key on clients in /root/.ssh/slack-key
3) Add a stanza like this on clients to /root/.ssh/config:
Host slack-master
        User slack
        IdentityFile /root/.ssh/slack-key

4) Pick a master server, make a CNAME "slack-master" pointed at it
5) Install the slack-master package on that server
6) Put the public key on that server in ~slack/.ssh/authorized_keys (see the
    example in /usr/share/doc/slack-master)
