PRE-1.0:
* slack: make level-1 verbosity less noisy, easier to read
* slack: propagate verbosity levels down to modules
* slack-sync: chmod cache 700
* abstract out common code somehow
* separate slack-runscript, slack-runfixfiles
* allow ./configure to set paths
* install private key and ssh config when installing (or maybe leave to a role)
* allow username in urls
* backup directories
* manpages for slack, slack-backends
--------
LATER:
* record what roles have been installed

* build in support for heterogenous underlying distros, like subsets have
  (maybe just assing subroles)

* Allow easy review of changes before install
* Nagging email about pending changes
* Use backup functionality to store original versions of files,
  so we can uninstall
* Use backups to store intermediate versions of files for rollbacks
* Make a helper that uses tripwire or AIDE to find files that
  have been modified and upload them to repository, so people
  can be *really* lazy.
