* manpages for slack, slack-backends

* Use backup functionality to store original versions of files,
  so we can uninstall
* Use backups to store intermediate versions of files for rollbacks
* Make a helper that uses tripwire or AIDE to find files that
  have been modified and upload them to repository, so people
  can be *really* lazy.
