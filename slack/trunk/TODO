# $Id$
* make level-1 verbosity less noisy, easier to read
* propagate verbosity levels down to modules

* install private key and ssh config when installing (or maybe leave to a role)

* record what roles have been installed
* allow username in urls
* backup directories

* manpages for slack, slack-backends

* build in support for heterogenous underlying distros, like subsets have
  (maybe just assing subroles)

* Allow easy review of changes before install
* Nagging email about pending changes
* Use backup functionality to store original versions of files,
  so we can uninstall
* Use backups to store intermediate versions of files for rollbacks
* Make a helper that uses tripwire or AIDE to find files that
  have been modified and upload them to repository, so people
  can be *really* lazy.
