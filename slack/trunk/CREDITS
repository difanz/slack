(Note: A lot of this is from memory, so if I left out or mischaracterized
 something you contributed, let me know!)

Roman Marxer: lots of help in intial design
              helped come up with concept of subroles.
Frank Cusack: lots of strongly-worded early criticism :)
              the one who said someone should name a project "slack".
Mikal Still: nagged me near-daily to license the damn thing and put it
             up on the web
David Lowry: fixed my hacky spec file
Googlers: gave me feature requests, bug reports, many of which I dutifully
          filed in the TODO file and haven't fixed yet :/
