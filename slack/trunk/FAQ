What's so great about slack, then?
  Nothing, really.  The code is kind of a mess, and I'm sure you can
  come up with better :)

  People seem to like it, though, and if pressed, I'd say that it's
  pretty simple to use, and probably close to what you want to be doing,
  and that it doesn't tend to force some weird strict philosophy on you.

  Also it probably gets major points for existing.

That's it?
  Pretty much.

Are you associated with the Church of the Subgenius?
  I don't *think* so...

What does the name stand for?
  "Sysadmins' Lazy Auto-Configuration Kit".  Yes, this was a "backronym" --
  I named it "slack" on a dare (see CREDITS).
    
What is slack written in?
  Perl

Why isn't it written in [insert language]?
  I wanted to use an interpreted language that I didn't have to convince
  sysadmins to install on their machines, and shell would have ended up
  looking even worse than this Perl.  Sometimes I do regret it, though.
  :/

Shouldn't people be using (cfengine/conf packages/whatever)?
  Probably.  Feel free to try to convince them.

How do I set up slack to use rsyncd over ssh?
    1) Generate a public/private keypair for SSH
    2) Put the private key on clients in /root/.ssh/slack-key
    3) Add a stanza like this on clients to /root/.ssh/config:
    Host slack-master
            User slack
            IdentityFile /root/.ssh/slack-key

    4) Pick a master server, make a CNAME "slack-master" pointed at it
    5) Install the slack-master package on that server
    6) Put the public key on that server in ~slack/.ssh/authorized_keys (see the
        example in /usr/share/doc/slack-master)
