Tell
.BR diff (1)
to use unified output format.
.TP
\fB\-\-diff\fR \fIPROG\fR
Use this program for diffing, instead of diff.
.TP
\fB\-\-fakediff\fR
Make a fake diff for file modes and other things that are not file
contents.  Default is on, can be disabled with \-\-nofakediff.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR  \fB\-\-recursive\fR
Recursively compare any subdirectories found.
.TP
\fB\-N\fR  \fB\-\-new\-file\fR
Treat missing files as empty.  Default is on, can be disabled with
\-\-nonew\-file.
.TP
\fB\-\-unidirectional\-new\-file\fR
Treat only missing files in the first directory as empty.
.TP
\fB\-\-from\-file\fR
Treat arguments as a list of files from which to read filenames to
compare, two lines at a time.
.TP
\fB\-0\fR  \fB\-\-null\fR
Use NULLs instead of newlines as the separator in \-\-from\-file mode.
.TP
\fB\-\-devnullhack\fR
You have a version of diff that can't deal with \-N when not in
recursive mode, so we need to feed it /dev/null instead of the
missing file.  Default is on, can be disabled with \-\-nodevnullhack.

.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Output version info.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Output this help.

FILES are `FILE1 FILE2' or `DIR1 DIR2' or `DIR FILE...' or `FILE... DIR'.
If \fB\-\-from\-file\fR or \fB\-\-to\-file\fR is given, there are no restrictions on FILES.
If a FILE is `-', read standard input.
